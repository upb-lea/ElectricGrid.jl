# Summary

The ElectricGrid.jl toolbox provides a transient simulation framework
for electric energy grids based on power electronic converters. 
With a few lines of code, a parameterised electric grid model on component level can 
be initialised in Julia. 
An example grid is shown in the figure below.

![Exemplary electric energy grid in a simplified single phase representation.\label{fig:grid}](ExampleGrid.png)

By means of  state-space models (set of first order ordinary differential equations), electrical energy grids can be constructed and simulated in a short time, which can be utilised
for synthetic data generation (e.g., for data-driven meta-modelling) and to compare grid control methods.


# Statement of need

Decentralised, electrical energy networks have special demands on operating and control procedures 
to ensure a continuous and efficient energy supply and
simultaneously play an important role in the integration of renewable energy sources [@Guerrero2013]. This applies both in connection with conventional centralised power grids and for islanded microgrids in remote areas [@Lund2017].
Due to their high efficiency and flexibility, power electronic converters have become the standard tool for integrating renewable energy sources, energy storages and loads in 
electrical energy grids. 
The field of power electronics covers the application of solid-state electronics to the control and
conversion of electric power, which is performed with semiconductor switching 
devices such as diodes or power transistors.
This includes energy conversion in terms of voltage and current amplitude, frequency
and phase angle, as well as the number of phases between two or more electrical energy systems to be connected.

Controlling (decentralised) electric grids is a challenging task due to their stochastic, heterogeneous 
and volatile characteristics (in particular regarding the connected loads).
At the same time, high requirements are made with regard to aspects such as safety, quality and availability.
This results in a high demand for comprehensive testing of new control concepts during their development phase and comparisons with the state
of the art to ensure their feasibility.
This applies in particular to emerging data-driven control approaches such as 
reinforcement learning (RL), the stability and operating behavior of
which cannot be evaluated a priori [@Garcia2015].
Besides RL methods, being data-driven, result in a model-free and self-adaptive controller design with little human effort labeling them a promising tool for controlling unknown or changing systems targeting the above described challanges.
However, there is a need for further research into the requirements for energy networks in terms of safety, robustness and availability before RL-based controllers can be used in real applications [@ZhangRL2018], [@GlavicRL2018].
 

``ElectricGrid.jl`` is a Julia package for setting up realistic electric grid simulations with support for control options. A number of parameters are made avaible to the user to evaluate the various control options. If no details are given, all parameters are generated automatically, either through randomness on a physically meaningful basis or by verified design methods.
This enables both experts from the field of electrical energy networks to test certain configurations and 
experts from the field of artificial intelligence to test new control approaches
without any prior knowledge of electrical engineering.
Therefore, ``ElectricGrid.jl`` is designed to be used by students, academics, and industrial researchers in the field of simulation and data-driven analysis of electrical energy systems. 
The primary objective of the toolbox is to facilitate entry for new users into 
the modeling, control, and testing of
small to large scale electric power grids and to provide a platform on which different control methods (including RL) can be compared under defined conditions (benchmarks).

The experiments are based on dynamic simulations in the time domain which allows for accurate control
and test investigations during transients and steady state down to component level. 
This is an essential difference to already available open-source solutions for the simulation of electrical energy grids like PyPSA [@Brown2017], Powermodels.jl [@Coffrin2018] and pandapower 
[@Thurner2018] which, in contrast, usually perform the calculations 
in a (quasi)-stationary state. Also these frameworks tend to focus on large-scale power systems at the transmission and distribution grid level, 
which does not allow an evaluation of, e.g., control on component level in case of load fluctuations in the grid.
In addition, few tools like [@lara2023revisiting] already exist in Julia, which offer dynamic simulations. 
However, the latter is based on different simplifications (e.g., assumption of a symmetric grid, fixed frequency, ...) and 
also do not offer an interface to RL toolboxes.
To ensure a seamless integration of the control algorithms, the Gymnasium-based API [@FaramaFoundation2023] should be used, which has been established as a standard in recent years.
For other projects implementing the Gymnasium-based API, such as GridAlive (based on Grid2Op [@Donnot2020]) and ChroniX2Grid [@Marot2020], the focus remains on top-down control and steady-state models.
Therefore, ``ElectricGrid.jl`` provides a tool to close these highlighted gaps.


# Interfaces for control and reinforcement learning  


The API is designed to provide a user-friendly interface to connect a modeled electric energy grid 
with a wide range of classical control methods like shown in the figure below.

![Overview of the functionality and interconnections of the ElectricGrid.jl framework.\label{fig:jeg}](Overview_EG.png)
 
Already provided are classic controllers (i.e., industry standard contollers) like linear feedback proportional integral (PI) in the direct-quadrature-zero (DQ0) rotating reference frame. These control methods can be used out of the box including automatical tuning procedures. 
Many basic auxiliary functionalities for the essential operation of electric power grids are provided too such
as coordinate transformations for basic controller classes, data logging, measurement of real and imaginary powers, 
and phase-locked loops for frequency and phase angle extraction. 
The interface provided by @Tian2020Reinforcement is also available for training 
data-driven control approaches like RL.
This enables users who want to integrate contemporary open-source Julia-based RL toolboxes
such as ``ReinforcementLearning.jl`` [@Tian2020Reinforcement].
Following this structure, nearly every control approach, including data-driven RL, can 
be implemented and tested with ``ElectricGrid.jl`` in a relatively short amount of time.

# Availability and installation

``ElectricGrid.jl`` is supported and tested on Linux, Windows and macOS.
The package should be installed using the Julia package manager. In a Julia terminal run the follwing:
```
import Pkg
Pkg.add("ElectricGrid")
```

Alternatively, it can also be installed from the Github source code. To do that, clone the repository, start Julia, activate the project by pressing `]` to access Pkg mode and then `activate path/to/ElectricGrid` or `activate .` If you started Julia in your ElectricGrid directory and afterwards run `instantiate`.
  
The source code, guide and 
examples are available on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/upb-lea/JuliaElectricGrid.jl).
