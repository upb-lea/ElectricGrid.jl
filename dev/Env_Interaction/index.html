This section is intended to show how to interact with the environment and, above all, how to extract, store the data and covers the following topics:</p><ul><li><h3>Apply actions,</h3></li><li><h3>Data hook (how to tap the simulated data stream),</h3></li><li><h3>AC grid example.</h3></li></ul><p>The interactive content related to the section described here can be found in the form of a notebook <a href="https://github.com/upb-lea/ElectricGrid.jl/blob/main/examples/notebooks/Env_Interaction_DEMO.ipynb">here</a>.</p><h2 id="Basic-interaction-with-the-environment"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Basic-interaction-with-the-environment">Basic interaction with the environment</a><a id="Basic-interaction-with-the-environment-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Basic-interaction-with-the-environment" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The dynamic behaviour of the environment is simulated using linear state-space models.  It interacts step-wise with the agent/controller like shown in the figure below.  Based on the input/action <code>u</code> at timestep <code>k</code> the state <code>x</code> is calculated.</p><p><img src="../assets/RL_interaction.png" alt/></p><p>Based on that action <code>u_k</code> and the internal state-space model, the system response is evolved for one timestep and the new states <code>x_k+1</code> are calulated. The state-space model is defined depending on the electric components - for more information about the ordinary differential equations behind,... see <a href="https://upb-lea.github.io/ElectricGrid.jl/dev/NodeConstructor_Theory/">The Nodecontructor - Theory</a>.</p><p>In the following will be described how to use the described parameter dict to define a simple, small example <code>env</code> to learn how to interact with it. This environment consists of a single phase electrical power grid with 1 source and 1 load as shown in the figure below. For reasons of clarity, only phase a is shown:</p><p><img src="../assets/S1_L1_all.png" alt/></p><p>To get an <code>env</code> consisting of that specific setting with the correct filter type and load, the parameter dict is defined in beforehand and handed over to the <code>env</code>. Instead of <code>num_sorces</code> and <code>num_loads</code>, now the parameter dict and the connection matrix <code>CM</code> is used which defines if there is a connection between two nodes (e.g., source &lt;-&gt; load) or not.  If there is a connetion the corresponding matrix entry is not zero, if there is no connection the entry is <code>0</code>. For more information about the CM matrix see <a href="https://upb-lea.github.io/ElectricGrid.jl/dev/NodeConstructor_Application/">The Nodecontructor - Application</a>.</p><p>To create a usefull example we first calulate a load which fits in case of power rating to the power of the source. Therefore, the function <code>ParallelLoadImpedance()</code> provied by the <code>ElectricGrid</code> package is used which calulates the passive parameters for a load for specified apparant power.</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">using ElectricGrid

It is based in the <code>run</code> command provided by the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/blob/master/src/ReinforcementLearningCore/src/core/run.jl">ReinforcementLeaning.jl/run</a> toolbox and, therefore, can be used to <code>learn</code> a control task or to <code>simulate</code> a fixed setup.</p><p>First we take a look onto simulating the behaviour of an env without learning. Therefore, the <code>Simulate()</code> function from the <code>MultiController</code> is used.  This acts as a configuration tool to define the corresponding classic controllers and RL agents. Additionally, it links inputs to the <code>env.state_ids</code> and outputs to the <code>env.action_ids</code>.</p><p>In our example, we only apply classic controllers to learn how the tool works (learning with RL agents is investigated in <code>RL_Single_Agent_DEMO.ipynb</code>).  The interaction of the different components (env, agent, classic controllers, wrapper,...) is shown in the diagram below.</p><p><img src="../assets/Overview_EG.png" alt/></p><p>The depicted multiagent ensures that the states and actions for every source are exchanged with the correct agent or classic controller. This is depending on the <code>control_types</code> and <code>mode</code>s. Therefore, the <code>SetupAgents(env)</code> method returns a <code>Controller</code> of type <code>MultiController</code>.</p><p>Then, the experiment is executed for (default) one episode. The length of the episode is defined depending on the parameter <code>env.maxsteps</code> (default = 500), which alternatively can be defined via <code>env.t_end</code> and <code>env.ts</code>.  Inside <code>Simulate()</code> the run command (RL.base) executes 500 steps applying the defined controllers in the env. Every step the control inputs are calculated based on the corresponding states and the env is evolved for <code>ts</code>. Then, the new state is given to the controller/agent again. </p><p>The 500 steps only gets executed if none of the defined voltage and current limits of the states are exceeded (which would be equivalent to a system crash). In that case, a flag in the env is set (<code>env.done = true</code>) which terminates the episode.</p><p>To investigate the env &lt;-&gt; agent interaction (without learning), the <code>Simulate()</code> method can be used.</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">Controller = SetupAgents(env);

Via theses hooks the data to be collected is stored in a <code>DataFrame</code> labeled via the state and action IDs. This all happens using the <code>DataHook</code> provided by the <code>ElectricGrid</code> package.</p><p>This <code>DataFrame</code> can be seen in the output of the upper cell. It contains 500 rows - one for each simulated step. In the different colons the information about the simulation is stored, e.g., the number of the episode, time, states, actions... By default a <code>DefaultDataHook</code> is generated which collects all available information about the states of the <code>env</code>. </p><p>If we are interested how the state of the current through the filter inductor of source 1 (first state in the env <code>source1_i_L1_a</code>) evolves over time, we can grap the data like follows:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">id = env.state_ids[1] # get first state_id
