For the sources, we assume that the voltage is provided by a DC link, so we can assume that the voltage can be modeled by a voltage source and a filter. Loads are divided into active loads, which, based on an internal function, can take power from the network, and passive loads, which are statically described by their resistive, capacitive and/or inductive component and thus dissipate a certain power.
